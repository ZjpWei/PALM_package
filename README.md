## PALM

`PALM` is a R package and it implements a quasi-Poisson-based framework designed for robust, scalable, and reproducible identification of covariate-associated microbial features in large-scale microbiome association studies and meta-analyses. The package can perform single-study association analysis and meta-analysis across multiple studies. This tutorial provides examples demonstrating meta-analysis.

## System requirements

The `PALM` package (version 0.1.0) should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before setting up the package, users should have R version 4.3.0 or higher.

The package depends on the following R packages: `Mass`, `dplyr`, `brglm2` and `Rcpp`.

## Installation guide

Install package from github.
```{r}
devtools::install_github("ZjpWei/PALM_package")
```

Install package by [source code](https://github.com/ZjpWei/PALM_package/blob/main/PALM_0.1.0.tar.gz)
```{r}
install.packages("./PALM_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Quick start guide

The following are minimal examples on functionalities of `PALM`. For more detailes, please refer to its [vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ZjpWei/PALM_package/blob/main/doc/PALM_vignette.html).

* Load package and data
```{r}
library("PALM")
data("CRC_data", package = "PALM")
CRC_abd <- CRC_data$CRC_abd
CRC_meta <- CRC_data$CRC_meta

########## Generate summary statistics ##########
rel.abd <- list()
covariate.interest <- list()
for(d in unique(CRC_meta$Study)){
  rel.abd[[d]] <- CRC_abd[CRC_meta$Sample_ID[CRC_meta$Study == d],]
  disease <- as.numeric(CRC_meta$Group[CRC_meta$Study == d] == "CRC")
  names(disease) <- CRC_meta$Sample_ID[CRC_meta$Study == d]
  covariate.interest[[d]] <- matrix(disease, ncol = 1, dimnames = list(names(disease), "disease"))
}
```

* Perform meta-analysis
```{r}
meta.result <- palm(rel.abd = rel.abd, covariate.interest = covariate.interest)
```
